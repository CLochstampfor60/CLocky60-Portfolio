# Challenge #2: Online-Web-Portfolio

## Description:
* Develop a interactive web application from scratch.
* The web application will harbor current and future portfolio of work, with the adaptability to showcase future skills and talents as time progresses in the professional world.

___

## User Story:
* AS AN employer,
* I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples,
* SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

___

## Acceptance Criteria:
<u>GIVEN</u> I need to sample a potential employee's previous work...

* <i>WHEN</i> I load their portfolio,
 <br><b>THEN</b> I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.

* <i>WHEN</i> I click one of the links in the navigation,
 <br><b>THEN</b> the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

* <i>WHEN</i> I click on the link to the section about their work,
<br><b>THEN</b> the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.

* <i>WHEN</i> I am presented with the developer's first application,
<br><b>THEN</b> that application's image should be larger in size than the others.

* <i>WHEN</i> I click on the images of the applications,
<br><b>THEN</b> I am taken to that deployed application.

* <i>WHEN</i> I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices,
<br><b>THEN</b> I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.

___

## Completed Work:

* Developer's (Last) name shows at the top right and a recent photo loads under the 'About-Me' section and with a avatar-picture underneath the (last) name header.

* Navigation: header icons at the top right navigate without errors to their proper locations on the webpage. Footer icons navigate to their proper locations as well (i.e., only GitHub). At this time of this assignment completion, 'Placeholders' were added to locations throughout the HTML and CSS files where there was insufficient information to provide. This will be updated as time progresses in the professional world. As for now, when those Placeholders are 'clicked-on,' the user is taken back to the top of the current web application page.

* Portfolio Links: Placeholders were also included within the 'Project' cards located on the right side of the 'Work' section.

* Cursor-Hover Responsiveness: when the user navigates his or her cursor over the header-icons, titled-images, and the footer-icons, the webpage displays to the user a a responsive style. The style serves as a 'eye-pleasing' function for the user by contrasting those sections against the static portions of the web application page and it's different sections.

* Mobile Fluidity and Responsiveness: the user can access and readily navigate the web application page across multiple platforms. Appropriate Media Queries were included to make the web application flexible on various screens and devices. The layout adapts to the user's viewpoint in an aesthetically appealing manner.

* Deployment: Application deployed at live URL, loads with no errors, applied to GitHub repository with updated application code.
